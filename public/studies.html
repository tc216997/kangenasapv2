                        <p class="abstract-body">The generation of reactive oxygen species is thought to cause extensive oxidative damage 
                          to various biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and protein. In this study, the preventive, suppressive, 
                          and protective effects of in vitro supplementation with electrolyzed-reduced water on H2O2-induced 
                          DNA damage in human lymphocytes were examined using a comet assay. Pretreatment, cotreatment, and 
                          posttreatment with electrolyzed-reduced water enhanced human lymphocyte resistance to the DNA strand 
                          breaks induced by H2O2 in vitro. Moreover, electrolyzed-reduced water was much more effective than 
                          diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water in preventing total RNA degradation at 4 and 25 degrees C. In addition, 
                          electrolyzed-reduced water completely prevented the oxidative cleavage of horseradish peroxidase, 
                          as determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Enhancement of the antioxidant activity of 
                          ascorbic acid dissolved in electrolyzed-reduced water was about threefold that of ascorbic acid dissolved in 
                          nonelectrolyzed deionized water, as measured by a xanthine-xanthine oxidase superoxide scavenging assay system, 
                          suggesting an inhibitory effect of electrolyzedreduced water on the oxidation of ascorbic acid.</p>

                        <p class="abstract-body">Degradation of the 3 pesticides (acephate, omethoate, and dimethyl dichloroviny phosphate [DDVP])
                          by electrolyzed water was investigated. These pesticides were commonly used as broad-spectrum insecticides in 
                          pest control and high-residual levels had been detected in vegetables. Our research showed that the electrolyzed 
                          oxidizing (EO) water (pH 2.3, available chlorine concentration:70 ppm, oxidation-reduction potential [ORP]: 1170 mV) 
                          and the electrolyzed reducing (ER) water (pH 11.6, ORP: -860 mV) can reduce the pesticide residues effectively. 
                          Pesticide residues on fresh spinach after 30 min of immersion in electrolyzed water reduced acephate by 74% (EO) 
                          and 86% (ER), omethoate by 62% (EO) and 75% (ER), DDVP by 59% (EO) and 46% (ER), respectively. The efficacy of using 
                          EO water or ER water was found to be better than that of using tap water or detergent (both were reduced by more 
                          than 25%). Besides spinach, the cabbage and leek polluted by DDVP were also investigated and the degradation 
                          efficacies were similar to the spinach. Moreover, we found that the residual level of pesticide residue decreased 
                          with prolonged immersion time. Using EO or ER water to wash the vegetables did not affect the contents of Vitamin C,
                            which inferred that the applications of EO or ER water to wash the vegetables would not result in loss of nutrition.</p>

                        <p class="abstract-body">Active oxygen species or free radicals are considered to cause extensive oxidative 
                          damage to biological macromolecules, which brings about a variety of diseases as well as aging. The ideal 
                          scavenger for active oxygen should be 'active hydrogen'. 'Active hydrogen' can be produced in reduced water 
                          near the cathode during electrolysis of water. Reduced water exhibits high pH, low dissolved oxygen (DO), 
                          extremely high dissolved molecular hydrogen (DH), and extremely negative redox potential (RP) values. 
                          Strongly electrolyzed-reduced water, as well as ascorbic acid, (+)-catechin and tannic acid, completely 
                          scavenged O.-2 produced by the hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (HX-XOD) system in sodium phosphate buffer 
                          (pH 7.0). The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of reduced water is stable at 4 degrees C for over a 
                          month and was not lost even after neutralization, repeated freezing and melting, deflation with sonication,
                          vigorous mixing, boiling, repeated filtration, or closed autoclaving, but was lost by opened autoclaving or 
                          by closed autoclaving in the presence of tungsten trioxide which efficiently adsorbs active atomic hydrogen.
                            Water bubbled with hydrogen gas exhibited low DO, extremely high DH and extremely low RP values, as does 
                            reduced water, but it has no SOD-like activity. These results suggest that the SOD-like activity of reduced 
                            water is not due to the dissolved molecular hydrogen but due to the dissolved atomic hydrogen (active hydrogen). 
                            Although SOD accumulated H2O2 when added to the HX-XOD system, reduced water decreased the amount of H2O2 produced 
                            by XOD. Reduced water, as well as catalase and ascorbic acid, could directly scavenge H2O2. Reduce water suppresses 
                            single-strand breakage of DNA b active oxygen species produced by the Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid in a 
                            dose-dependent manner, suggesting that reduced water can scavenge not only O2.- and H2O2, but also 1O2 and .OH.</p>

                        <p class="abstract-body">Oxidative stress is recognized widely as being associated with various disorders 
                          including diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. It is well established that hydrogen has a reducing 
                          action. We therefore investigated the effects of hydrogen-rich water intake on lipid and glucose metabolism 
                          in patients with either type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). We performed a 
                          randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 30 patients with T2DM controlled by diet and 
                          exercise therapy and 6 patients with IGT. The patients consumed either 900 mL/d of hydrogen-rich pure water or 
                          900 mL of placebo pure water for 8 weeks, with a 12-week washout period. Several biomarkers of oxidative stress,
                           insulin resistance, and glucose metabolism, assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test, were evaluated at 
                           baseline and at 8 weeks. Intake of hydrogen-rich water was associated with significant decreases in the levels 
                           of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (ie, modifications that increase the net negative charge 
                           of LDL), small dense LDL, and urinary 8-isoprostanes by 15.5% (P < .01), 5.7% (P < .05), and 6.6% (P < .05), 
                           respectively. Hydrogen-rich water intake was also associated with a trend of decreased serum concentrations of
                            oxidized LDL and free fatty acids, and increased plasma levels of adiponectin and extracellular-superoxide 
                            dismutase. In 4 of 6 patients with IGT, intake of hydrogen-rich water normalized the oral glucose tolerance 
                            test. In conclusion, these results suggest that supplementation with hydrogen-rich water may have a beneficial
                            role in prevention of T2DM and insulin resistance.</p>

                        <p class="abstract-body">Ethanol consumption disturbs the balance between the pro- and anti-oxidant systems 
                          of the organism, leading to oxidative stress. Electrolyzed-reduced water (ERW) is widely used by people 
                          in East Asia for drinking purposes because of its therapeutic properties including scavenging effect of 
                          reactive oxygen species. This study was performed to investigate the effect of ERW on acute ethanol-induced 
                          hangovers in Sprague-Dawley rats. Alcohol concentration in serum of ERW-treated rats showed significant 
                          difference at 1 h, 3 h and 5 h respectively as compared with the rats treated with distilled water. Both alcohol 
                          dehydrogenase type 1 and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase related with oxidation of alcohol were significantly increased 
                          in liver tissue while the level of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in serum was markedly 
                          decreased 24 h after pre-oral administration of ERW. Moreover, oral administration of ERW significantly activated 
                          non-ezymatic (glutathione) and enzymatic (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, Cu/Zn-superoxide 
                          dismutase and catalase) antioxidants in liver tissues compared with the control group. These results suggest that 
                          drinking ERW has an effect of alcohol detoxification by antioxidant mechanism and has potentiality for relief of 
                          ethanol-induced hangover symptoms.</p>

                        <p class="abstract-body">Oxidative stress is produced under diabetic conditions and is likely involved 
                          in progression of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction found in diabetes. Both an increase in reactive 
                          oxygen free radical species (ROS) and a decrease in the antioxidant defense mechanism lead to the 
                          increase in oxidative stress in diabetes. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) with ROS scavenging ability 
                          may have a potential effect on diabetic animals, a model for high oxidative stress. Therefore, the 
                          present study examined the possible anti-diabetic effect of ERW in two different diabetic animal models. 
                          The genetically diabetic mouse strain C57BL/6J-db/db (db/db) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic 
                          mouse were used as insulin deficient type 1 and insulin resistant type 2 animal model, respectively. 
                          ER000000W, provided as a drinking water, significantly reduced the blood glucose concentration and improved
                          glucose tolerance in both animal models. However, ERW fail to affect blood insulin levels in STZ-diabetic 
                          mice whereas blood insulin level was markedly increased in genetically diabetic db/db mice. This improved 
                          blood glucose control could result from enhanced insulin sensitivity, as well as increased insulin release. 
                          The present data suggest that ERW may function as an orally effective anti-diabetic agent and merit further 
                          studies on its precise mechanism.</p>

                        <p class="abstract-body">In the two-stage cell transformation theory, cancer cells first receive initiation, 
                          which is mainly caused by DNA damage, and then promotion, which enhances transformation. Murine Balb/c 3T3 
                          cells are widely used for transformation experiments because they lose contact inhibition ability when 
                          transformed. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW), which is produced near a cathode during electrolysis of water, 
                          is an alkaline drinking water that is beneficial to health. ERW contains a high concentration of dissolved 
                          hydrogen and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with a small amount of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles 
                          (Pt nps) derived from Pt-coated titanium electrodes. Pt nps stably disperse in aqueous solution for a long time, 
                          and convert hydrogen molecules to active hydrogen (atomic hydrogen) that can scavenge ROS. Therefore, ERW 
                          supplemented with synthesized Pt nps is a model strong reduced water. This is the first report that ERW 
                          supplemented with synthesized Pt nps strongly prevents transformation of Balb/c 3T3 cells. ERW was prepared 
                          by electrolysis of 0.002 M NaOH solution using a batch-type electrolysis device. Balb/c 3T3 cells were treated 
                          with 3-methyl cholanthrene (MCA) as an initiation substance, followed by treatment with 
                          phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) as a promotion substance. MCA/PMA-induced formation of a transformation 
                          focus was strongly suppressed by ERW supplemented with Pt nps but not by ERW or Pt nps individually. ERW 
                          supplemented with Pt nps suppressed transformation at the promoter stage, not at initiation, suggesting that 
                          ERW supplemented with Pt nps suppressed the PMA-induced augmentation of intracellular ROS. ERW supplemented with 
                          Pt nps is a potential new antioxidant against carcinogenesis.</p>

                        <p class="abstract-body">96-99% of the "friendly" or residential microflora of intestinal tract of humans 
                          consists of strict anaerobes and only 1-4% of aerobes. Many diseases of the intestine are due to a 
                          disturbance in the balance of the microorganisms inhabiting the gut. The treatment of such diseases 
                          involves the restoration of the quantity and/or balance of residential microflora in the intestinal 
                          tract. It is known that aerobes and anaerobes grow at different oxidation-reduction potentials (ORP). 
                          The former require positive E(h) values up to +400 mV. Anaerobes do not grow unless the E(h) value is 
                          negative between -300 and -400 mV. In this work, it is suggested that prerequisite for the recovery and 
                          maintenance of obligatory anaerobic microflora in the intestinal tract is a negative ORP value of the 
                          intestinal milieu. Electrolyzed reducing water with E(h) values between 0 and -300 mV produced in 
                          electrolysis devices possesses this property. Drinking such water favours the growth of residential 
                          microflora in the gut. A sufficient array of data confirms this idea. However, most researchers explain 
                          the mechanism of its action by an antioxidant properties destined to detox the oxidants in the gut and 
                          other host tissues. Evidence is presented in favour of the hypothesis that the primary target for 
                          electrolyzed reducing water is the residential microflora in the gut.</p>

                          <strong style="padding-right:3px;">PURPOSE:</strong> Cisplatin is a widely used anti-cancer drug in the treatment of a wide range of 
                          tumors; however, its application is limited by nephrotoxicity, which is affected by oxidative stress. We have 
                          reported that molecular hydrogen (H(2)) acts as an efficient antioxidant (Ohsawa et al. in Nat Med 13:688-694, 2007). 
                          Here we show that hydrogen efficiently mitigates the side effects of cisplatin by reducing oxidative stress.

                          hydrogen gas (1% H(2) in air). Furthermore, instead of inhaling hydrogen gas, we examined whether drinking water 
                          containing hydrogen (hydrogen water; 0.8 mM H(2) in water) is applicable by examining oxidative stress, mortality, 
                          and body-weight loss. Nephrotoxicity was assessed by morphological changes, serum creatinine and blood urea

                          <strong style="padding-right:3px;">RESULTS: </strong>Inhalation of hydrogen gas improved mortality and body-weight 
                          loss caused by cisplatin, and alleviated nephrotoxicity. Hydrogen was detected in blood when hydrogen water was 
                          placed in the stomach of a rat. Consuming hydrogen water ad libitum also reduced oxidative stress, mortality, 
                          and body-weight loss induced by cisplatin in mice. Hydrogen water improved metamorphosis accompanying decreased 
                          apoptosis in the kidney, and nephrotoxicity as assessed by serum creatinine and BUN levels. Despite its protective

                        <p class="abstract-body">Electrolyzed water (EW) is gaining popularity as a sanitizer in the 
                          food industries of many countries. By electrolysis, a dilute sodium chloride solution dissociates 
                          into acidic electrolyzed water (AEW), which has a pH of 2 to 3, an oxidation-reduction potential of 
                          >1,100 mV, and an active chlorine content of 10 to 90 ppm, and basic electrolyzed water (BEW), which 
                          has a pH of 10 to 13 and an oxidation-reduction potential of -800 to -900 mV. Vegetative cells of 
                          various bacteria in suspension were generally reduced by > 6.0 log CFU/ml when AEW was used. However, 
                          AEW is a less effective bactericide on utensils, surfaces, and food products because of factors such as 
                          surface type and the presence of organic matter. Reductions of bacteria on surfaces and utensils or 
                          vegetables and fruits mainly ranged from about 2.0 to 6.0 or 1.0 to 3.5 orders of magnitude, respectively. 
                          Higher reductions were obtained for tomatoes. For chicken carcasses, pork, and fish, reductions ranged 
                          from about 0.8 to 3.0, 1.0 to 1.8, and 0.4 to 2.8 orders of magnitude, respectively. Considerable 
                          reductions were achieved with AEW on eggs. On some food commodities, treatment with BEW followed by 
                          AEW produced higher reductions than did treatment with AEW only. EW technology deserves consideration 
                          when discussing industrial sanitization of equipment and decontamination of food products. 
                          Nevertheless, decontamination treatments for food products always should be considered part of an 
                          integral food safety system. Such treatments cannot replace strict adherence to good manufacturing and 
                          hygiene practices.
