                    We all know we have to drink a gallon a day but we don’t.  It’s either very difficult to find the 
                    time to drink that much water, or we put in no effort AND we substitute water with sugary beverages, 
                    coffee etc. The result of lacking proper hydration brings people to chronic illnesses, getting sick 
                    easier, and making our bodies more acidic. The more acidic your body is, the weaker it is overall.                    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We all have friends and families that we care about deeply. You never know when something can happen 
                    to you, and when something does you’ll wonder what went wrong. My mom had high blood pressure for as 
                    long as I can remember, and we both have eczema and dry skin. I’m sure we all know people who are 
                    suffering from something and the only thing we can think about is how we can help out. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I wasn’t one of those people who cared deeply about health. I ate whatever I want, I loved drinking 
                    Snapple and I dislike vegetables. After doing research for years about the water we’re drinking, I 
                    also came across an article according to Nobel Prize winner <a href="#a1-ref">Dr. Otto Warburg<sup>1</a></sup>, in his Preventing 
                    Cancer letter. "Not only do cancers thrive in low-oxygenated cells, acidic environments with plenty 
                    of sugar, but so do diabetes, respiratory issues, and chronic issues like arthritis and high blood 
                    pressure.""
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today I will speak to you about how as something as simple as water, and how to determine whether 
                    the water you’re drinking is good for you, will improve your health dramatically. I will explain 
                    what is in our water, and how to know whether or not you’re drinking healthy water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being dehydrated is the worst thing you can do to yourself. Even if you’re drinking water daily, it 
                    doesn’t mean you’re hydrating properly. The human body has a pH level of 7.4. Your blood is 7.4, and 
                    your sweat is also 7.4pH. So what can you do to make sure you’re drinking water that’s at least 7.4 
                    or higher? According to <a href="#a1-ref">Dr. Corinne Allen<sup>2</sup></a>, the human brain is the hardest part of your body to hydrate. 
                    Our brains are 80% water. The adult human body as a whole is up to 60% water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order for your body to reach its full potential and become stronger, you need to move your body to 
                    an alkalized state. In the article, <a href="#a1-ref">Cells and cell biochemistry,<sup>3</sup></a> "Organic compounds 
                    always contain carbon and usually hydrogen and oxygen." Water is the most important and abundant inorganic compound 
                    within the body, accounting for 55-60% of adult body mass. The cells in a human body have a positive 
                    charge, so now we know that hydrogen has a negative charge and when you put a positive charge and a 
                    negative charge together, THEY ATTRACT. So now we need to think, all right what kind of water can I 
                    get that has good molecular hydrogen so my cells can absorb the water better, and hydrate me?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The human body is right around 7.4pH.  You would want to do your best to either eat foods that are 
                    healthier than 7.4pH or drink water that is alkalized. But Joe, there’s bottled water that is alkalined 
                    like Essentia, and it has 9.5 pH. It says so on the bottle!” First of all, there’s a difference between 
                    alkalined and alkalized. To alkaline a bottle of water, water companies use chemicals to keep it at a 
                    higher pH level. Alkalized is a process that uses electricity or watts to purify the water. In a YouTube 
                    video, <a href="#a1-ref">Dr. Michael Donaldson<sup>4</sup></a> does a demonstration of all the water brands we see and drink on a daily basis, including brands that advertise they are alkaline at 8 pH to 9.5 pH, by using a pH sampler. As you can see by the chart, if the water turns blue or purple, it is good to drink, and anything on the other side of the scale, you should avoid. He also showed a process using the straw, to show how the water will break down in your body after you drink it by blowing carbon into the cups. The alkaline bottled water compounds changed due to added chemicals, and started turning acidic.

                    Another way to test your liquids is something called an ORP meter. In a world we live in, there are things 
                    we cannot see. Here is what we know. There is a continuous exchange of electrons that take place between 
                    substances in the air, in the earth, in water, AND in our BODIES!! This phenomenon is known as ion exchange. 
                    In an effort to reach stability, substances that are lacking electrons are desperately seeking out electrons 
                    wherever they can. These substances are referred to as oxidizing agents. Oxidize means to become combined 
                    chemically with oxygen. When something is oxidizing, that means it’s still for a period of time. On the 
                    contrary, substances which have a surplus of electrons are capable of donating their extra electrons; these 
                    substances are referred to as reducing agents, or what we like to call them, anti-oxidizing, which are 
                    antioxidants. We all know antioxidants are good for you. <a href="#a1-ref">Dr. Oz<sup>5</sup> </a>aired a TV show about 2 years ago talking 
                    about the importance of antioxidants, and ran a pH test on the whole audience to see how many people were 
                    acidic and how many were alkalized. Antioxidants protect the human body from damage caused by harmful 
                    molecules called free radicals. Wikipedia explains and shows diagrams that free radicals are any atom or 
                    molecule that has a single unpaired electron, and causing aging in the body.<a href="#a1-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> The body produces its own 
                    antioxidants to counter free radical damage but the more antioxidants you have, the healthier you’ll be. 
                    Antioxidants also protect your DNA and fights off viruses, diseases, and cancers. A cancer research study 
                    done in 1880 by an embryologist named <a href="#a1-ref">John Beard<sup>7</sup></a>, he explains that eating raw vegetables and fruits, 
                    especially deep green leafy vegetables, promotes a healthful alkaline pH in the body as well and providing 
                    valuable nutrients and antioxidants. So ORP is short for Oxidation-reduction potential. It’s a measurement 
                    that indicates the degree to which a substance is capable of oxidizing or anti-oxidizing another substance. 
                    A positive ORP reading indicates that a substance is an oxidizing agent. The higher the positive reading, 
                    the worse it is for your body. The more negative the reading is, the healthier it is. As seen with the CEO 
                    of Chanson Water USA, he explains what ORP is and does a test with famous brands in a YouTube video. He 
                    comes to a conclusion with the readings that most bottled water has a +250 reading, Gatorade and sodas 
                    have +400.<a href="#a1-ref"><sup>8</sup></a>

                    The solution came to, is buying a good alkalized filtering machine. There’s a lot of different kinds out there, 
                    and they’re all pricey. But when you get the right one, you’ll never have to buy another bottle of water again. 
                    I did hard research for a few years, and I’ve learned a lot. I’m financing a machine right now called an SD501 
                    from Enagic. The water that comes out of the machine can be anywhere from 2.5pH to 11.5pH, you can choose. 
                    The push I needed was through extra testimonials I saw all over the internet, along with numerous amount of 
                    doctors backing the product as well.

                    <strong class="extra-bold">1.&nbsp;</strong>
                    Before financing the machine I made sure of a few things. How is the water filtered, and how is it alkalized.

                    channels, they’re integral membrane proteins from a larger family of major intrinsic proteins that form pores 
                    in the membrane of a biological cell, mainly facilitating transport of water between cells. He also goes over 
                    micro-clusters. Micro-Clusters penetrate cellular walls 6x more efficiently to transport nutrients and oxygen 
                    for superior hydration, performance, and endurance. Most waters have too many micro-clusters clumped together 
                    in a molecule that our cells won’t accept. Our cells have a port to accept only 6 molecules clumped together, 
                    which in the end tapers down to allow rapid hydration.

                    The inside of a cell normally has a positive charge and the outside cell membrane has a negative charge. A cells 
                    charge maintains about 120 millivolts, and as we age it drops down. When it drops down low to around a 60 millivolt 
                    range, that’s where people usually have some kind of chronic condition. The reason why maintaining 120 millivolts is 
                    important is because it works in conjunction with your heartbeat. When your heart beats it causes a cell to contract. 
                    When the cell compresses down, that’s what causes it to excrete co2 and toxins. Then when the heart beats again, it 
                    basically pops the cell open and that causes it to draw in oxygen and nutrition.

                    Knowing all this, this is what makes the machine I got for my family and I so special. It re-processes and restructures 
                    the water to a high antioxidant solution water. This is the type of water supply that is very limited on our planet. 
                    Picture a lightning strike hitting water, and purifying it. What Enagic has done is they’ve added a filter to clean the 
                    water and they’ve captured that lightning strike, and it runs the water through 7 highly charged plates and spits out 
                    water that has been restructured. It makes the water more bioavailable for hydrating, and it carries a bit of a charge. 
                    So when you choose for example 9.5pH, the water makes some molecules even smaller for better transportation throughout 
                    your blood cells. This is all done through the process of electrolysis.

                    Today, I went over ways to improve your health in the most simplest of ways, through drinking clean water. I discussed 
                    the problems people face when not hydrating properly. I informed you how to test your waters, and liquids, to see if 
                    what you’re drinking is harmful for your body. I also gave you in depth details on how the water affects your bodies, 
                    and going over scientific terms you probably never heard before. We all have the ability to find ways to improve our 
                    health taking baby steps. We were also blessed that at this day and age we have a lot of resources to find answers to 
                    our questions. Let’s take advantage of that. I got my machine on February 14th. My mom’s flakey skin problem is gone, 
                    both of our eczema problems are disappearing, my mom’s high blood pressure that she had for as long as I can remember 
                    is now normal. I don’t get heartburn anymore, my acid reflux from drinking too much alcohol is gone, I’m sleeping better 
                    at night and feeling more energized throughout the day and on top of that my mood is more positive. Thank you for letting 
                    me chew your ears off today, I hope we can all move in a positive direction and take care of our bodies. We only get one. 
                    If you have any other questions, feel free to email me anytime. My contact form is at the bottom of the page.

                    Threats on Tap: Widespread Violations Highlight Need for Investment in Water Infrastructure and Protections               
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    America has a drinking water crisis. An NRDC study has found that contaminants that may harm human health are found in tap water in every state in the nation.                
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Established in 1974, the Safe Drinking Water Act is one of our bedrock environmental laws, consisting of rules that regulate about 100 contaminants found in drinking water. NRDC has documented serious problems with our outdated and deteriorating water infrastructure, widespread violations and inadequate enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act for more than 25 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our analysis shows that in 2015 alone, there were more than 80,000 reported violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act by community water systems. Nearly 77 million people were served by more than 18,000 of these systems with violations in 2015. These violations included exceeding health-based standards, failing to properly test water for contaminants, and failing to report contamination to state authorities or the public. What’s worse, 2015 saw more than 12,000 health-based violations in some 5,000 community water systems serving more than 27 million people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2016, we released What’s in Your Water: Flint and Beyond, which detailed the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan, and contextualized a larger, national crisis around lead in drinking water. This report picks up where that one left off, detailing a stunning number of violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act around the nation.

                    Exposure to these contaminants can lead to cancer and may be linked to reproductive impacts such as miscarriages and birth defects. In 2015, there were 11,311 violations (4,591 health-based) at community water systems serving 25,173,431 people (12,584,936 health-based). Formal enforcement measures were taken in 12.4 percent of all cases and 23.0 percent of health-based cases.

                    The presence of coliforms in drinking water indicates that possible presence of organisms that can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, and headaches in otherwise-healthy people. These impacts can be much more serious and even life-threatening for children, the elderly, and immune-compromised people. In 2015, there were 10,261 violations (2,574 health-based) at community water systems serving 17,768,807 people (10,118,586 health-based).

                    Safe drinking water is something we Americans tend to take for granted, until a crisis like lead contamination in Flint, Michigan, makes us wonder what chemicals could be lurking in our own taps.                
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Flint was a wake-up call for Americans, but it’s not the only place in the United States with tap water problems,” says Erik Olson, director of NRDC’s Health program. “Thousands of other cities and small towns across the country are serving water with lead or other contamination problems to millions of people.” The NRDC Health team has fought to protect drinking water—both locally and nationally—for decades. In fact, Lynn Thorp, national campaigns director for the nonprofit organization Clean Water Action, says NRDC has been the group’s most valued partner in efforts to enforce the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. “Together we’ve been a watchdog for the public at every stage of implementation and for all the many parts of the law,” she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there have been victories over the years, you should still remain vigilant about the contaminants that might be in your pipes, faucets, or local water supply. Here’s what you should know and how you can stay safe.
                  </p>
                  <hr class="modal-hr-spacing">
                  <h4 class="extra-bold">
                    It’s not just about lead
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                   All public water suppliers in the United States are required to uphold certain levels of water quality. As long as these requirements are met, Olson says, most Americans can drink their local tap water without worry. Still, violations remain widespread, and some water systems have contaminants that aren’t regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to a new NRDC report, nearly 77 million Americans got drinking water from systems that violated federal protections in 2015, and more than a third of this number relied on systems that did not comply with standards put in place to protect health. Millions of other Americans’ water suppliers failed to test water safety properly or didn’t report test results to health authorities or customers—potentially sweeping many more health risks under the rug.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These numbers likely understate the extent of the problem, given underreporting and the fact that many contaminants aren’t even monitored or regulated. For instance, common contaminants such as perchlorate and PFOA/PFOS (chemical cousins of Teflon) occur in millions of Americans’ tap water, but because they aren’t regulated by the EPA, they don’t show up in these already staggering figures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sensitive groups, like pregnant women and children, are at higher risk for health complications, especially from the following contaminants:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Lead:&nbsp;</strong> 
                    Likely the most famous bad guy, this heavy metal can leach from lead pipes and plumbing fixtures, especially when the water flowing through them is corrosive. It can cause neurological and behavioral problems in children and adverse health effects in adults. “It’s a more common problem in cities with older water systems,” NRDC Health team scientist Kristi Pullen Fedinick says, “but what a lot of people don’t realize is that even relatively new brass fixtures and faucets can still contain significant amounts of lead. Just because your home is less than 20 years old doesn’t necessarily mean you’re lead-free.”

                    <strong class="extra-bold">Atrazine:&nbsp;</strong>
                    This endocrine-disrupting chemical is one of the most commonly detected pesticides in U.S. waters. NRDC studies have found its contamination is most common in drinking water across the Midwest and the southern United States. The EPA currently monitors a sample of community water systems to determine if atrazine concentrations pose a risk to public health, but NRDC has called on the government to phase out the use of this chemical entirely.

                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Pathogens:&nbsp;</strong>
                    Bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause illness can find their way into water supplies that are inadequately treated to kill germs. Fortunately, these pathogens are much better controlled today than they once were. After a 1993 waterborne-disease outbreak in Milwaukee sickened more than 400,000 people, Olson says, “NRDC really led the charge in changing the EPA’s rules and safeguards.” But clearly much more remains to be done.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Chlorine treatment by-products:&nbsp;</strong>
                    Chemicals used in drinking water’s disinfection process, such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, may cause cancer and reproductive problems if present in high quantities.

                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Arsenic:&nbsp;</strong>
                    The EPA estimated in 2000 that nearly 36 million Americans drank water containing arsenic at or above 3 parts per billion—the level NRDC had urged be established as a drinking water standard. “The EPA had delayed and delayed updating the arsenic standard that was originally issued in the 1960s, but we finally got them to relent and update the arsenic number based on modern science in the early 2000s,” Olson says. Since then, arsenic levels across the country have declined as a result, he adds, but the contaminant is still worth looking out for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Nitrates:&nbsp;</strong>
                    Though nitrates occur naturally in plants and soil at low concentrations, they have become a widespread contaminant due in part to their use as fertilizer. Runoff from factory farms flows into surface and ground water and ends up in our drinking water. The EPA set a limit of 10 parts per million for nitrates, which can be harmful to pregnant women and infants. In rare cases, exposed infants can develop blue baby syndrome, a potentially fatal illness that prevents the blood from carrying oxygen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Radioactive contaminants:&nbsp;</strong>
                    Most radioactive elements found in drinking water occur naturally, but radioactive material from the production of nuclear weapons, energy, and medicines can also get into drinking supplies through leaks or improper waste storage. Exposure can cause cancer or kidney failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Vinyl chloride:&nbsp;</strong>
                    Used to make PVC plastic products, such as some pipes, this cancer-causing contaminant can leach from older PVC piping and has been found in the drinking water of a small number of communities across the country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Perchlorate:&nbsp;</strong>
                    This widespread toxic chemical, used in rocket fuel, explosives, and road flares, can interfere with thyroid hormone production. Perchlorate has been detected in the water in at least 26 states, yet there is no federal standard for its presence in drinking water. In 2011, after more than a decade of pressure from environmental and health groups led by NRDC, the EPA announced that it would set such a standard—but it still hasn’t even proposed a rule for the contaminant. After NRDC filed a lawsuit against the EPA for its failure to act in the time frame allotted by the Safe Drinking Water Act, the agency committed in a consent decree in late 2016 to get a proposed perchlorate standard out in 2018 and a final standard by 2019.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong class="extra-bold">Pharmaceuticals:&nbsp;</strong>
                    Prescription drugs enter our water supply when patients release traces in their urine or flat-out flush unused medication down the sink or toilet. NRDC has petitioned the FDA to pay more attention to medicines making their way into the environment, and a 2010 NRDC report provided recommendations for reducing the flow of these drugs into our waters.
